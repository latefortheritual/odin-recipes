    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Bolognese isn't your typical tomato-based spaghetti sauce. It originated in Bologna, Italy, and is a hearty ragù
        that starts with a soffritto — that all-important blend of finely diced onion, carrot, and celery — loaded up
        with a variety of ground meats and cooked with white wine. Then, a relatively small amount of tomatoes are added
        along with stock; the sauce is cooked slow and low to develop and concentrate the flavors. To finish, it's
        enriched with a touch of cream.</p>
