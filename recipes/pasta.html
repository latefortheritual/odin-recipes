    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Bolognese isn't your typical tomato-based spaghetti sauce. It originated in Bologna, Italy, and is a hearty ragù
        that starts with a soffritto — that all-important blend of finely diced onion, carrot, and celery — loaded up
        with a variety of ground meats and cooked with white wine. Then, a relatively small amount of tomatoes are added
        along with stock; the sauce is cooked slow and low to develop and concentrate the flavors. To finish, it's
        enriched with a touch of cream.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>tomatoes</li>
        <li>carrot</li>
        <li>meat</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large, heavy saucepan until shimmering. Add the onion, carrot,
            celery, and pancetta and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened
            but not browned, about 8 minutes. Scrape the vegetable mixture into a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil to the saucepan and heat until just shimmering. Add the beef,
            veal, and pork and cook over moderately high heat until just barely pink, about 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
